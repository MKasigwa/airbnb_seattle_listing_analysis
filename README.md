# Seattle Airbnb Data science

## Context

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

## Objectives 

1. Explore and profile the data to correct any quality issues
2. Prepare and reformat the data for visualization
3. Visualize the data and identify key insights and recommendations.

## Content

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Inspiration

- Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
- What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
- By how much do prices spike?
- Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?

<p>After the three first years, the market was probably still being established but as we see new host enter the average price declines presumably because there was a lot more competition for customers.</p>
